SINE (SINE Is Not Escape)

SINE is designed with the following in mind:
- Sine is supposed to serve static configuration organized in a tree;
- access must be very fast, ideally fetching predefined data from memory;
- must be self contained (single jar file contains all software and dependencies; any host with a Java JVM runs it).

Usage:

java -Dsine_log_file=/home/john/apps/sine/sine.log -Dstore=/home/john/apps/sine/confs -jar /home/john/apps/sine/sine.jar
